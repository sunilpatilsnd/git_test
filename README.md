My First Repo!
Hello Odin!

### We can create new git repository by clicking on the + icon in the header and click on new repository. 

### We can copy a repository on to local machine by using git clone git@github.com:user_name/repository_name.git

### The default name of the connection is origin

### origin in git push origin main is the connection name

### main is the name of the branch we are pushing the code to. 

### git has two stages named staging and commit. (Commit is like a waiting room for the changes before they are pushed to remote reposite). 

### We can check the status of the files in git by the command git status. 

### We can add the files to staging area by the command git add file_name or git add .

### We can commit the files in staging area by the command git commit -m "commit message".

###  We can push the committed changes to remote repository by the command git push origin master

### We can look at the history of the commits by using the command git log
